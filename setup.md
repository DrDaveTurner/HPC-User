## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Your instructor should provide you with information on how to access a
Linyx system or SuperComputer.
You will need to use the directions below to access that system using
a terminal window so you can use the command line interface.
You will also need to transfer the code files to the Linux system, again
by following the directions for you operating system below.
Once they are copied over, you may edit them on the Linux side with
vim or nano, or if you are more comfortable you can edit the files on
you laptop or desktop and transfer them to the Linux system instead.

### Windows

You may use PuTTY to ssh into a system that your instructor should provide
information for.  In the long run, the MobaXTerm app can be installed and used
if desired.  It provides the same terminal access as PuTTY but also provides a
convenient file transfer capability.  This is especially useful if you are more
comfortable editting your files on the Windows side then transferring them over
to the Linux system.

### MacOS

Use Terminal.app or iTerm2.app.  You will ssh into the Linux system that
your instructor provides information for.

### Linux

Use Terminal and ssh into the Linux system that your instructor provide 
information for.
