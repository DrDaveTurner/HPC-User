## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [code zip file](data/code.zip) and unzip it to your Desktop.

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Your instructor should provide you with information on how to access a
Linyx system or SuperComputer.
You will need to use the directions below to access that system using
a terminal window so you can use the command line interface.
You will also need to transfer the code files to the Linux system, again
by following the directions for your operating system below.
Once the code files are copied over, you may edit them on the Linux side with
vim or nano, or if you are more comfortable you may edit the code files on
your laptop or desktop and transfer them to the Linux system instead.

### Windows

You may use PuTTY to ssh into a system that your instructor should provide
information for.  In the long run, the MobaXTerm app can be installed and used
if desired.  It provides the same terminal access as PuTTY but also provides a
convenient file transfer capability.  This is especially useful if you are more
comfortable editting your files on the Windows side then transferring them over
to the Linux system.

### MacOS

Use Terminal.app or iTerm2.app.  You will ssh into the Linux system that
your instructor provides information for.  You can edit your files on 
the Linux system with vim or nano, or if you have a different editor
on your Mac system you may edit the code files there and scp them
over to the Linux system each time.

### Linux

Use Terminal and ssh into the Linux system that your instructor provide 
information for.  You can edit your files on 
the Linux HPC system with vim or nano, or if you have a different editor
on your Linux laptop or desktop you may edit the code files there and scp them
over to the Linux system each time.

### Programming Language for Example Code

Your instructor will direct you to click on the tab of a particular
programming language below.  This will select the language for all
example codes and diagrams for the first few chapters of this workshop.
As you go through each lesson, you may always click on the other tabs
to see how each code is implemented in the different programming
languages.

**NOTE** - Examples are currently only available in Python.
